Public Game Art
=============

This repository contains *public* game art scavenged from the internet, and compiled in order to facilitate development processes.

The goal is to support these use-cases:

- Rapidly create concept art to convey a vision or idea
- Find assets which can be used in free games
- Use commercial-licensed assets for commercial games

Because of this, we currently categorize art as follows:

- **Commercial:** Usable in commercial (paid) games. This is the most liberal allowance.
- **Non-Commercial:** Only alloed to be used in free games.

Please send pull requests to include suitable art which you find.

Most of this work is currently slanted towards top-down adventure/RPG games.
